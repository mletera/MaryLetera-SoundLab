Hip Synth README

Team: Mary Letera Edem (David) Dotse  To use, make sure battery is plugged in and Arduino is on. Plug xbee receiver into a usb port on laptop. Open “hackathon-live” set and open the HipAccelReader maxpatch to make sure that it is set to read the correct USB port (corresponding to the xbee). Once set, select “poll belt” and adjust volume. 

The accelerometer values from the belt are read in and used as partials to the additive synth in the M4L-instrument patch, and as parameters for color blending each video input.   Credits:  Belt construction, Arduino programming/soldering - Mary (BEFORE hackathon - spring ’23)  Synth programming/sound design, performance - Mary  Generative videos - Edem
